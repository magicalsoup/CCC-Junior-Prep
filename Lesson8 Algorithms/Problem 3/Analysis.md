# Analysis
> This problem seems pretty straight forward, just implement literally what the problem statement states

> ## Time Complexity
>> If might seem that the implementation with an O(K &times; C) complexity might be a bit slow, as it can be up to 10<sup>9</sup>, but since the dmoj judge can process about that number in a second, and with a 2 second time limit, this solution will pass
