# Analysis
> After reading this problem, the word **'swap'** should give you a connection to bubblesort immediately,      
> this is just a simple bubble sort implementation, just keep track of how many swaps it takes for each sort
> ## Time Complexity

>> Though N is not given, L is, and I can tell you that N is **not an arbitrary** number, so lets just say **N <= 50**,      
>> L is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 50, so the time complexity would be **O(L^2 * N)**, or about **O(N^3)**   
>> That makes this run in about **O(50^3)** or **O(75 000)**, which will run in time   

> ## Memory Limit
>> An array of 50 integers is below the memory limit

> ## Data types
>> Numbers are less than or equal to 50, no risk of overflow
