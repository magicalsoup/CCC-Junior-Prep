# Analysis
> After you read the problem, this question is asking you to do a bubble sort, print the array once and then print out the array after each swap    
> ## Time Complexity
>> N is <= 20, so this will definetly pass in time
> ## Memory Limit
>> A array of 20 integers is well under the memory limit
> ## Data Types
>> A integer data type will suffice
