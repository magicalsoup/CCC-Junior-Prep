# Analysis
> After trying it out a while, its quite a troll! By looking at the memory limits, you can tell that you can't hold    
> an array with 1 000 000 longs, what you had to do was just print out the input
> ## Time Complexity
>> O(N), as you read the input in O(N) time, though a fast reader is recommended, as alot of you will tle, 
>> so search up on documentations on your languages fast readers, and implement them, I'll talk more about them later on
> ## Memory Limit
>> since you don't really store anything, you don't have to worry about memory limit at all
> ## Data Types
>> Use long, or a 64 bit integer data type, as the input can get as large as 2^63 - 1, or use a string, both work
