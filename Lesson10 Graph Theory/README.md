# Welcome To lesson # 10
> Today I will be focusing On 3 Topics
> 1. Type of Graphs
> 2. DFS
> 3. BFS

# 1 Type of Graphs
> ## Terms
> - ```Vertices``` or ```nodes```: are basically the dotes or points on the graph
> - ```Edges```: are the lines connecting the ```Vertices```
> - ```Forest```: is a bunch of ```trees``` (not literally)
> 1. Trees
>   - Trees have a special property that every ```node``` is ```connected``` and there are exactly ```n - 1 edges```
> 2. Cyclic Graphs
>   - These graphs form a cycle, or loop (you end up where you started)
> 3. Disconnected Graphs
>   - That means there are componenets of the graph that are not connected, meaning there could be multiple trees, or a ```forest```

# DFS
> it means ```depth first search```

> it searches through the graph by going as deep as possible, then go back up and repeat the process
> it does this with the help of recursion
> It
